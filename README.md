Ontology of social sustainable development
The social sustainability is one of the three pillars of the sustainable development. 
In the article the respective domain ontology is developed as a part of the existing ontological metamodel of the sustainable development. 
А methodology for the ontology building is proposed including concept exploration, controlled vocabulary and thesaurus creating; ontology formalization, 
verification, querying and publication. The main concepts of the ontology are extracted from a text corpus covering well-established and authoritative sources, 
approved articles, standards and commonly accepted regulations of United Nations. 
For the purpose, manual selection and automatic text mining by the language processing toolkit GATE is performed. 
The ontology is formalized by OWL in Protégé environment and after verification its code in GitHub is published.
Keywords: social sustainable development, domain ontology, concept extraction, text mining, ontology formalization
